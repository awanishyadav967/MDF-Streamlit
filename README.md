## Project Description
The project aims to introduce participants to Model Description Format (MDF), a tool for defining and simulating dynamical systems using a modular approach. MDF enables users to describe complex models in a structured format, making it easier to develop, share, and reproduce computational models across various domains, including biology, physics, and engineering.

### Task 2: Create an OSB Account and Edit a Jupyter Notebook

- Created a new account on Open Source Brain v2.
- Created a new workspace from the ModECI MDF OSBv2 repository.
- Installed the latest version of MDF in the workspace.
- Opened and reviewed the Simple Example Jupyter notebook to understand MDF concepts.
- Created a new notebook in the workspace, implementing an MDF model with connected nodes representing a dynamical system in biology or physics.

### Task 3: Create a Simple Streamlit Application Using MDF

- Developed a simple graphical application using Streamlit.
- Imported MDF and allowed model execution at the press of a button.
- Implemented output display and potentially plotted the output at multiple time points.
- Hosted the public app and provided a link for mentors to review.
